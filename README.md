# Two Stream 3D CNN for Video Classification

</div>

## Description

ðŸ““ This project made with the PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, PyTorch Video.

This project implements the task of classifying different medical diseases.

We use a two stream based method combine the 3D CNN network for video classification.

The whole procedure is divided into two steps:  

1. using the detection method to extract the character-centered region and save it as a video.
2. a hidden-in RAFT based method to extract the optical flow of the corresponding images.
3. use the RGB images with the corresponding optical flow feed into a 3D CNN based network for training.

Detailed comments are written for most of the methods and classes.
Have a nice code. ðŸ˜„

## How to run  

First, install dependencies

```bash
# clone project   
git clone https://github.com/ChenKaiXuSan/Two_Stream_PyTorch.git

# install project   
cd Two_Stream_PyTorch
pip install -e .   
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Next, navigate to any file and run it.  

```bash
# module folder
cd project

# run module (example: mnist as your main contribution)   
python main.py --[some paramer]
```
