## Abstract

Assessment of adult spinal deformity with video is a very useful tool for early diagnosis of the gait spinal disease.
At present, many gait recognition methods based on 3D convolutional neural networks (3D CNN) present outstanding performance, but still have some challenge in video-based diagnosis method.

1. 3D CNNs can be sensitive to context.
2. The body edge provides important spatial information that helps the network focus on the relevant regions for gait analysis and improves the overall performance of the recognition system. 
3. Meanwhile, it remains a challenge for the extraction of spatiotemporal information from RGB video for gait and posture changes in walking.
   
In this study, we propose an advanced two-stream 3D CNN approach for video based spinal disease measurement, that integrates segmentation and optical flow analysis to capture gait motion changes.
We design a two-stream 3D Convolutional Neural Network architecture that combines the spatial and temporal features. 
The spatial stream processes the segmented body regions to extract static features related to spinal deformity, while the temporal stream analyzes the optical flow information to capture the dynamic aspects of spinal motion during gait. 
The fusion of static and dynamic features enhances the diagnostic accuracy of the system.
Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, incorporating segmentation and optical flow analysis, achieves superior performance in ASD diagnosis, with 0.7964 mean accuracy, 0.7599 F1 score and 0.8600 AUROC score.

## Description

ðŸ““ This project made with the PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, PyTorch Video.

This project implements the task of classifying different medical diseases.

We use an advanced two stream based method combine the 3D CNN network for video classification.

The whole procedure is divided into two steps:  

1. using the detection method to extract the character-centered region and save it as a video.
2. a hidden-in RAFT based method to extract the optical flow of the corresponding images.
3. using the RGB images with the corresponding optical flow feed into a 3D CNN based network for training.

Detailed comments are written for most of the methods and classes.
Have a nice code. ðŸ˜„
